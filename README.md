# 07-Crypto-Sentiment-Index

This project is a group exercise in utilizing adn applying all concepts learned during Phase 1 of the course, including HTML, CSS, Javascript, and much more.

This project involved creating two HTML pages, one landing page and one charting page, to display information about cryptocurrency for use by traders.
The landing page displays general info about various cryptocurrencies with outside links to Wikipedia.
The charting page presents options for selecting a cryptocurrency (currently only BTC functional) and queries a crypto-news API to gather media articles for the creation of a "sentiment index" which is simply a count of the number off articles written on any given day. The investment thesis presumes that days with higher article counts will exhibit greater volatility in the price movement of the underlying cryptocurrency.
